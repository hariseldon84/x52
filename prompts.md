@dev.md  Let us look at the epic and stories and biuld a Dev tracker file known as powercodertasks.md in root folder. Add all the tasks related to all modules that needs to be developed. It can be various epics. Create a comprehensive table that lists out these tables where you list down all stories one by one , and share status of Frontend Development, Backend Development, Integrations Status, QA/QC status, CI/CD Status, Deployment Status in it. Also create an integrations.md file in core folder to list down all integrations required.

Check the entire codebase and confirm the Epic1 status completion. Then move on to development for Epic 2 stories. Update everything in powercodertasks.md whenever you develop anything.

Let us implement the pending epics and stories and develop the product further. Please update  powercodertasks.md and all epics and stories in core folder once done. Kindly review the code and not just the code comments to view what's done, review the epic and story and design specification and then build the Epic 4  and stories inside it. I think some stories in Epic 3 are done. and some backend dev is pending for some stories. Please also review whats pending in Epic 3 and make it complete before going to epic 4.

Create a file called bugs.md . Make a tabe of all errors that are reported (like   │
│   the ones above) and the fix applied by you. Table should have a row of bug         │
│   reported, date of bug reported, solution by you, test report and if its fixed. If  │
│   there are more fuxes to one bug, you line up a new row. Make sure you record       │
│   everything. This acts as a central logger for us
