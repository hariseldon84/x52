## 🔧 Git Commands & Repository Management

**Basics** : 
git clone <repository_url>
git pull

git init
git add .
git commit -m "Your descriptive commit message here"
git remote add origin <repository_url>
git push origin main

### 📥 Cloning the Repository

```bash
# Clone the repository to your local machine
git clone https://github.com/hariseldon84/x52.git
cd x52
```

### 🔄 Basic Git Workflow

#### Initial Setup (First Time)
```bash
# Configure your Git identity
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your-email@example.com"

# For GitHub privacy, use no-reply email:
git config --global user.email "yourusername@users.noreply.github.com"

# Set up credential helper (Windows)
git config --global credential.helper manager-core
```

#### Daily Development Workflow
```bash
# 1. Pull latest changes from remote
git pull origin main

# 2. Create a new branch for your feature
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# 3. Make your changes and stage them
git add .
# Or stage specific files:
git add path/to/specific/file.ts

# 4. Commit your changes
git commit -m "feat: add your feature description"

# 5. Push your branch to remote
git push -u origin feature/your-feature-name

# 6. Create a Pull Request on GitHub
# Visit: https://github.com/hariseldon84/x52/pulls
```

### 🚀 Pushing to Main Branch (Maintainers Only)

```bash
# Switch to main branch
git checkout main

# Pull latest changes
git pull origin main

# Merge your feature branch (if working locally)
git merge feature/your-feature-name

# Push to main
git push origin main
```

### 🔍 Useful Git Commands

```bash
# Check repository status
git status

# View commit history
git log --oneline

# View changes in files
git diff

# View remote repositories
git remote -v

# Switch branches
git checkout branch-name

# Create and switch to new branch
git checkout -b new-branch-name

# Delete a branch locally
git branch -d branch-name

# Delete a branch on remote
git push origin --delete branch-name

# Undo last commit (keep changes)
git reset --soft HEAD~1

# Undo last commit (discard changes)
git reset --hard HEAD~1

# Stash changes temporarily
git stash
git stash pop
```

### 🔐 Authentication Setup

#### Option 1: Personal Access Token (HTTPS)
1. Go to GitHub Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens
2. Generate new token with `repo` scope
3. Use token as password when prompted

#### Option 2: SSH Keys (Recommended)
```bash
# Generate SSH key
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your-email@example.com"

# Add to SSH agent
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519

# Copy public key to clipboard
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub

# Add to GitHub: Settings → SSH and GPG keys → New SSH key

# Update remote URL to use SSH
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:hariseldon84/x52.git
```

### 🛠 Troubleshooting

#### Common Issues and Solutions

**Authentication Failed:**
```bash
# Use Personal Access Token instead of password
# Or set up SSH authentication (see above)
```

**Email Privacy Error:**
```bash
# Use GitHub no-reply email
git config --global user.email "yourusername@users.noreply.github.com"
git commit --amend --reset-author --no-edit
git push --force-with-lease
```

**Merge Conflicts:**
```bash
# Pull latest changes
git pull origin main

# Resolve conflicts in your editor
# Then stage and commit
git add .
git commit -m "resolve: merge conflicts"
```

**Reset to Remote State:**
```bash
# Discard all local changes and match remote
git fetch origin
git reset --hard origin/main
```

### 📋 Commit Message Conventions
